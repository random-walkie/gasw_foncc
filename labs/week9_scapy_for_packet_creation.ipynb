    "# Sniffing Packets\n",
    "\n",
    "The sniff() function is one of Scapy's core packet capture functions that allows you to intercept network traffic. If we use `sniff(timeout=10, prn=lambda x: x.show())` as per the lab instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ timeout=10: This sets the packet capturing to run for exactly 10 seconds before stopping automatically.   \n",
    "+ prn=lambda x: x.show(): This is a callback function that determines what to do with each captured packet.   \n",
    "    + prn stands for \"print\" (though it's more general than that)\n",
    "    + The lambda x: x.show() is a small anonymous function that takes each packet (x) and calls the show() method on it\n",
    "    + The show() method displays a detailed breakdown of the packet structure, showing all layers (Ethernet, IP, TCP, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is the detailed structure of packets that the container captured during those 10 seconds. Each packet shows multiple network layers, from the lowest (Ethernet) to the highest (application data).\n",
    "\n",
    "From the output, I've captured HTTP traffic between my host machine and the Docker container on port 8888, which is the Jupyter server. The packet contains HTTP headers including authentication tokens and cookies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important security note: The captured packet contains sensitive information including:**\n",
    "\n",
    "+ An authentication token for the Jupyter server\n",
    "+ A CSRF token\n",
    "+ Cookie values\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates one reason why network sniffing tools require special privileges - they can capture sensitive information traveling over the network. You should be careful about sharing the complete output, as these tokens could potentially allow someone to access your Jupyter server if it's accessible from the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also a great example of why encrypted protocols like HTTPS are important - they would prevent this kind of sensitive information from being visible in a packet capture.\n",
    "Since this is just a temporary learning server running in a local Docker container, the security risk is minimal. Let me explain why:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter server is only accessible from my local machine (127.0.0.1 or localhost), which means only someone with access to my computer could potentially use these tokens.\n",
    "Docker containers typically have internal networking that isn't directly exposed to the internet unless specifically configured that way.\n",
    "The tokens shared have a limited lifespan - Jupyter tokens are typically valid only for the current session and expire when the server restarts.\n",
    "This is all within an educational context where I am specifically learning about packet sniffing and network analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, I am sanitising the payload when pushing to git:"
