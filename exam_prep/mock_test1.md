**Answer: B) Goodput is the amount of useful data transferred, while throughput includes protocol overhead**

*Explanation: Goodput is the application-level throughputâ€”the amount of useful data transferred (excluding protocol overhead, retransmissions, etc.) in a given time. Throughput is the total amount of data transferred, including all headers, acknowledgments, retransmissions, and other protocol overhead. Goodput is always less than or equal to throughput.*

### Question 43
What problem does Network Address Translation (NAT) help solve?
- A) Slow network performance
- B) IPv4 address exhaustion
- C) Weak encryption
- D) Inefficient routing

<details>
<summary>Show answer</summary>

**Answer: B) IPv4 address exhaustion**

*Explanation: Network Address Translation (NAT) was developed primarily to address IPv4 address exhaustion by allowing multiple devices within a private network to share a single public IP address. This conserves the limited pool of available public IPv4 addresses and extends the usable life of the IPv4 addressing scheme.*

### Question 44
What is the purpose of the Domain Name System (DNS) in networking?
- A) Assigning IP addresses to hosts dynamically
- B) Filtering network traffic based on domain names
- C) Translating domain names to IP addresses
- D) Routing packets between different networks

<details>
<summary>Show answer</summary>

**Answer: C) Translating domain names to IP addresses**

*Explanation: The Domain Name System (DNS) is responsible for translating human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into machine-readable IP addresses (like 93.184.216.34) that computers use to identify each other on the network. This allows users to access websites using memorable domain names rather than numerical IP addresses.*

### Question 45
Which of the following is NOT a function of the Transport layer in the OSI model?
- A) Segmentation of data
- B) Flow control
- C) Error detection and recovery
- D) Path determination

<details>
<summary>Show answer</summary>

**Answer: D) Path determination**

*Explanation: Path determination is a function of the Network layer (Layer 3), not the Transport layer (Layer 4). The Transport layer is responsible for segmentation of data, ensuring reliable delivery through error detection and recovery, flow control to prevent overwhelming the receiver, and identifying the specific application or service through port numbers.*
