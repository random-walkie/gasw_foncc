## Introduction to Computer Networks

### Definition and Purpose
Computer networking refers to interconnected computing devices that can exchange data and share resources using a system of rules called communications protocols. Networks enable resource sharing, communication, centralized data storage and management, and provide connectivity between diverse devices.

### Historical Development
Networks have evolved from simple point-to-point connections to complex global systems like the Internet. Key developments include:
- Early mainframe/terminal connections
- Local Area Networks (LANs)
- Wide Area Networks (WANs)
- Internet's evolution from ARPANET
- Wireless networking technologies

## Network Components and Organization

### Physical Components of a Network
Networks consist of three primary categories of components:

**1. End Devices**
- Interface between humans and the network
- Originate or receive data (source or destination)
- Examples: computers, servers, printers, VoIP phones, smartphones, tablets

**2. Intermediary Devices**
- Connect end devices to the network and route/forward data
- Filter data flow based on security settings
- Examples:
    - Switches (forward based on MAC addresses)
    - Routers (forward based on IP addresses)
    - Firewalls (enforce security policies)
    - Wireless Access Points (provide wireless connectivity)

**3. Media**
- Physical pathways for data transmission
- Types:
    - Metallic (copper) cables - Ethernet cables
    - Fiber optic cables - glass or plastic strands
    - Wireless - radio transmission through air

### Network Organization Types

**Peer-to-Peer Networks**
- Devices share resources directly without a dedicated server
- Each device can act as both client and server
- Advantages:
    - Easy to set up
    - Less complex
    - Lower cost
- Disadvantages:
    - No centralized administration
    - Less secure
    - Limited scalability
    - Lower performance with many users
- Best suited for small networks (up to 10 devices)

**Client-Server Networks**
- Uses dedicated servers to provide resources to client devices
- Servers manage resources and access control
- Advantages:
    - Centralized administration
    - Better security
    - Scalable to large environments
    - Higher performance
- Disadvantages:
    - More complex to set up and maintain
    - Higher cost
    - Single point of failure if not redundant
- Best suited for medium to large networks

- Examples: Traditional telephone networks
- Features:
    - Guaranteed bandwidth
    - Consistent performance
    - Inefficient use of resources during silence periods
    - Connection setup time before data transfer

**Packet-Switched Networks**
- Breaks messages into packets that can take different paths
- No dedicated path between devices
- Examples: The Internet, modern data networks
- Features:
    - Efficient use of network resources
    - Packets can take different routes to destination
    - No dedicated circuit required
    - More resilient to failures (redundancy)
    - Variable latency and performance

## Message Encoding and Communication

### Elements of Communication
- Source (sender)
- Destination (receiver)
- Channel (medium)
- Message (data)
- Protocol (rules)

### Key Terminology
- **Throughput**: Amount of data transmitted in a given time period
- **Goodput**: Amount of useful data (excluding overhead) transmitted in a given time
- **Bandwidth**: Maximum theoretical capacity of a medium
- **Latency**: Delay between sending and receiving data

### Message Encoding Process
1. **Encoding**: Converting information into a form suitable for transmission
2. **Transmission**: Sending the encoded message across the medium
3. **Decoding**: Converting received signals back into understandable form

### Message Formatting and Encapsulation
- **Encapsulation**: Process of adding headers and trailers as data moves down the protocol layers
- **De-encapsulation**: Process of removing headers and trailers as data moves up the protocol layers
- **Segmentation**: Dividing larger messages into smaller pieces for transmission

### Protocols
- A set of rules that determine how network devices communicate
- Define format, timing, sequencing, and error handling
- Organized into suites or stacks of related protocols

## The OSI Reference Model

### Overview
The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a communication system into seven distinct layers. Created by the International Standards Organization (ISO) in 1982.

### The Seven Layers (Top to Bottom)

### IPv4 Addressing
- 32-bit addresses written in dotted decimal format (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
- Divided into network portion and host portion by subnet mask
- Total of approximately 4.3 billion possible addresses

### IPv4 Address Classes (Traditional)
- **Class A**: First bit is 0, 8-bit network, 24-bit host (1.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255)
- **Class B**: First two bits are 10, 16-bit network, 16-bit host (128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255)
- **Class C**: First three bits are 110, 24-bit network, 8-bit host (192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255)
- **Class D**: Multicast addresses (224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255)
- **Class E**: Reserved (240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255)

### Subnetting
- Process of dividing a network into smaller subnets
- Subnet mask determines which portion is network vs. host
- Written in dotted decimal (255.255.255.0) or CIDR notation (/24)
- Allows more efficient use of address space
- Reduces broadcast domains
- Improves security through isolation

### IPv4 Address Types
- **Public IP**: Globally unique, routable on the internet
- **Private IP**: Used within private networks (not routable on internet)
    - 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 (10.0.0.0/8)
    - 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 (172.16.0.0/12)
    - 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0/16)
- **Static IP**: Manually assigned, fixed value
- **Dynamic IP**: Automatically assigned by DHCP

### IPv6 Addressing
- 128-bit addresses (8 groups of 4 hexadecimal digits)
- Example: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
- Provides approximately 3.4 × 10^38 addresses
- Advantages over IPv4:
    - Vastly expanded address space
    - Simplified header format
    - Built-in security (IPsec)
    - Elimination of NAT requirement
    - Better support for auto-configuration

## Network Address Translation (NAT)

### Purpose and Function
- Allows multiple devices to share a single public IP address
- Translates private IP addresses to a public IP address for internet access
- Developed primarily to address IPv4 address exhaustion
- Provides incidental security benefits by hiding internal addresses

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant PrivateNetwork as Private Network
    participant NAT as NAT Device
    participant Internet as Internet

    Note over PrivateNetwork: Internal Private IPs
    PrivateNetwork->>NAT: Send packet with private IP
    
    Note over NAT: Translates private IP to public IP
    NAT->>Internet: Forwards packet with public IP

    Internet-->>NAT: Receives response
    Note over NAT: Translates public IP back to private IP
    NAT->>PrivateNetwork: Delivers response to correct device

    Note right of NAT: NAT Translation Process
    Note left of PrivateNetwork: 192.168.1.10
    Note right of Internet: 203.0.113.45
```

### Types of NAT
- **Static NAT**: One-to-one mapping between private and public addresses
- **Dynamic NAT**: Pool of public addresses shared among private addresses
- **Network Address Port Translation (NAPT)**: Multiple private addresses share a single public address through different port numbers

### Advantages
- Conserves public IP addresses
- Provides a level of security by hiding internal network structure
- Simplifies internal network addressing
- Allows connection of private networks to internet without renumbering

### Limitations
- Complicates peer-to-peer applications
- Breaks end-to-end connectivity
- Can introduce latency
- Requires translation of embedded IP addresses in some protocols
- Creates single point of failure

## Routing and Path Determination

### Routing Basics
- Process of determining best path for data through networks

### Routing Methods
- **Static Routing**: Manually configured routes
    - Low overhead but doesn't adapt to changes
    - Good for small, stable networks
- **Dynamic Routing**: Automatic route discovery and adaptation
    - Adapts to network changes
    - Requires more CPU and bandwidth
    - Used in larger, more complex networks

### Routing Protocols
- **Interior Gateway Protocols** (within autonomous systems)
    - **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**: Link-state protocol using Dijkstra's algorithm
    - **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)**: Distance-vector protocol, simpler but less efficient
- **Exterior Gateway Protocols** (between autonomous systems)
    - **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**: Path-vector protocol used on the internet

### Path Determination
- Routers use metrics to determine best path
- Common metrics include:
    - Hop count (number of routers to cross)
    - Bandwidth (capacity of links)
    - Delay (time to reach destination)
    - Reliability (packet loss rate)
    - Cost (administrator-assigned value)

## Protocol Data Units (PDUs)

### Definition
Protocol Data Units (PDUs) are structured units of information transferred between network layers. Each layer has a specific name for its PDU.

    style Decapsulation fill:#fd9,stroke:#333
```
### PDUs by OSI Layer
- **Application, Presentation, Session Layers**: Data
- **Transport Layer**: Segment (TCP) or Datagram (UDP)
- **Network Layer**: Packet
- **Data Link Layer**: Frame
- **Physical Layer**: Bit

### Encapsulation Process
As data travels down the OSI model:
1. User data is generated at the Application layer
2. Transport layer adds header with port information → Segment
3. Network layer adds header with IP addresses → Packet
4. Data Link layer adds header with MAC addresses and trailer → Frame
5. Physical layer converts to bits for transmission

### De-encapsulation Process
As data travels up the OSI model at the receiver:
1. Physical layer converts signals to bits
2. Data Link layer processes the frame, removes header/trailer → Packet
3. Network layer processes the packet, removes header → Segment
4. Transport layer processes the segment, removes header → Data
5. Upper layers process the data for the application
